# Scripts/Client

- This is the folder containing scripts relative to the Client object of the game. The Client object is a singleton that manages the client-side of the game. It is always present in the game and is responsible for managing the game's state and the player's interactions with the game. Check its [README](Objects/Client/README.md) for more information, including details on these scripts.

#### What each script does

- `client_errors.gd`: Contains the error codes used by the client object.
- `client.gd`: Contains the client code.
- `client_test.gd`: Contains the client test code.
